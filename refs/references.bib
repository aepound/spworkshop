	Sparse Representation},

  abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of
	sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary
	that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse
	linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse
	representation are many and include compression, regularization in
	inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in
	this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms
	that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing
	dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either
	selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting
	the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques
	have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this
	paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order
	to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training
	signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation
	for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We
	present a new method-the K-SVD algorithm-generalizing the K-means
	clustering process. K-SVD is an iterative method that alternates
	between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary
	and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the
	data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update
	of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence.
	The K-SVD algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method
	(e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or matching pursuit). We analyze this
	algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and
	in applications on real image data},

as a specific case of the blind source separation problem where data

(ICA) assumes that the spectral components are close to statistically
independent and provides an unsupervised method for blind source

	structure that, if properly characterized, could enable more efficient

	contain reflectances of just a few materials, we propose that a sparse
	coding model is well-matched to HSI data. Sparsity models consider
	each pixel as a combination of just a few elements from a larger
	dictionary, and this approach has proven effective in a wide range
	of applications. Furthermore, previous work has shown that optimal
	sparse coding dictionaries can be learned from a dataset with no

	algorithms that assume the presence of pure spectra or side information).
	We modified an existing unsupervised learning approach and applied
	it to HSI data (with significant ground truth labeling) to learn
	an optimal sparse coding dictionary. Using this learned dictionary,
	we demonstrate three main findings: i) the sparse coding model learns
	spectral signatures of materials in the scene and locally approximates
	nonlinear manifolds for individual materials, ii) this learned dictionary
	can be used to infer HSI-resolution data with very high accuracy
	from simulated imagery collected at multispectral-level resolution,
	and iii) this learned dictionary improves the performance of a supervised
	classification algorithm, both in terms of the classifier complexity
	and generalization from very small training sets.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new sparsity-based algorithm for automatic
	target detection in hyperspectral imagery (HSI). This algorithm is
	based on the concept that a pixel in HSI lies in a low-dimensional
	subspace and thus can be represented as a sparse linear combination
	of the training samples. The sparse representation (a sparse vector
	corresponding to the linear combination of a few selected training
	samples) of a test sample can be recovered by solving an l0-norm
	minimization problem. With the recent development of the compressed
	sensing theory, such minimization problem can be recast as a standard
	linear programming problem or efficiently approximated by greedy
	pursuit algorithms. Once the sparse vector is obtained, the class
	of the test sample can be determined by the characteristics of the
	sparse vector on reconstruction. In addition to the constraints on
	sparsity and reconstruction accuracy, we also exploit the fact that
	in HSI the neighboring pixels have a similar spectral characteristic
	(smoothness). In our proposed algorithm, a smoothness constraint
	is also imposed by forcing the vector Laplacian at each reconstructed
	pixel to be minimum all the time within the minimization process.
	The proposed sparsity-based algorithm is applied to several hyperspectral
	imagery to detect targets of interest. Simulation results show that
	our algorithm outperforms the classical hyperspectral target detection
	algorithms, such as the popular spectral matched filters, matched

abstract = {Hyperspectral focal plane arrays typically contain many
pixels that are excessively noisy, dead, or exhibit poor signal to-
noise performance in comparison to the average pixel. These bad pixels
can significantly impair the performance of spectral target-detection
algorithms. Even a single missed bad pixel can lead to false
alarms. If the bad pixels are sparsely populated across the focal
plane, the over-sampling in both spatial and spectral dimensions of
the array can be capitalized upon to replace these pixels without
significant loss of information. However, bad pixels are frequently
localized in clusters, requiring a replacement strategy that rather
than providing a good estimate of the missing data will instead
minimize artifacts that may negatively affect the performance of
spectral detection algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate a robust
method to automatically identify bad pixels for short-wavelength
infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral sensors. In addition, we introduce a
novel procedure for the replacement of these pixels, which we
demonstrate provides a better estimate of the original pixel value
compared to interpolation methods for bad pixels found as both
isolated individuals and in clusters. The advantages of our technique
are discussed and demonstrated with data from several different
airborne sensor systems.},

	related to the Lagrange multiplier. We use this result to generalize
	an exact regularization result of Ferris and Mangasarian [Appl. Math.
	Optim., 23 (1991), pp. 266-273] involving a linearized selection
	problem. We also use it to derive necessary and sufficient conditions

  abstract = {Linear spectral unmixing is a popular tool in remotely sensed hyperspectral
	data interpretation. It aims at estimating the fractional abundances
	of pure spectral signatures (also called as endmembers) in each mixed
	pixel collected by an imaging spectrometer. In many situations, the
	identification of the end-member signatures in the original data
	set may be challenging due to insufficient spatial resolution, mixtures
	happening at different scales, and unavailability of completely pure
	spectral signatures in the scene. However, the unmixing problem can
	also be approached in semisupervised fashion, i.e., by assuming that
	the observed image signatures can be expressed in the form of linear
	combinations of a number of pure spectral signatures known in advance
	(e.g., spectra collected on the ground by a field spectroradiometer).
	Unmixing then amounts to finding the optimal subset of signatures
	in a (potentially very large) spectral library that can best model
	each mixed pixel in the scene. In practice, this is a combinatorial
	problem which calls for efficient linear sparse regression (SR) techniques
	based on sparsity-inducing regularizers, since the number of endmembers
	participating in a mixed pixel is usually very small compared with
	the (ever-growing) dimensionality (and availability) of spectral
	libraries. Linear SR is an area of very active research, with strong
	links to compressed sensing, basis pursuit (BP), BP denoising, and
	matching pursuit. In this paper, we study the linear spectral unmixing
	problem under the light of recent theoretical results published in
	those referred to areas. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of
	several available and new linear SR algorithms, with the ultimate
	goal of analyzing their potential in solving the spectral unmixing
	problem by resorting to available spectral libraries. Our experimental
	results, conducted using both simulated and real hyperspectral data
	sets collected by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Airborne Visible
	I- - nfrared Imaging Spectrometer and spectral libraries publicly
	available from the U.S. Geological Survey, indicate the potential
	of SR techniques in the task of accurately characterizing the mixed
	pixels using the library spectra. This opens new perspectives for
	spectral unmixing, since the abundance estimation process no longer
	depends on the availability of pure spectral signatures in the input
	data nor on the capacity of a certain endmember extraction algorithm
	to identify such pure signatures.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral sensors may use a 2D array such that one direction across the array is spatial and the other direction is spectral. Any pixels therein having very poor signal-to-noise performance must have their values replaced. Because of the anisotropic nature of information at the array, common image processing techniques should not be used. A bad-pixel replacement algorithm has been developed which uses the information closest in both spectral and spatial sense to obtain a value which has both the spectral and reflectance properties of the adjacent terrain in the image. A simple and fast implementation that `repairs' individual bad pixels or clusters of bad pixels has three steps; the first two steps are done only once: (1) Pixels are flagged as `bad' if their noise level or responsivity fall outside acceptable limits for their spectral channel. (2) For each bad pixel, the minimum-sized surrounding rectangle is determined that has good pixels at all 4 corners and at the 4 edge-points where the row/column of the bad pixel intersect the rectangle boundary (five cases are possible due to bad pixels near an edge or corner of the detector array); the specifications of this rectangle are saved. (3) After a detector data frame has been radiometrically corrected (dark subtraction and gain corrections), the spectral shapes represented by the rectangle edges extending in the dispersion direction are averaged; this shape is then interpolated through the two pixels in the other edges of the rectangle. This algorithm has been implemented for HYDICE.},

	This is a generalization of vector quantization in that one is interested

	To learn an environmentally adapted dictionary capable of concise

	as a model of some of the response properties of neurons in primary
	visual cortex. Previous work has focused on finding the best representation

	present an algorithm for learning an overcomplete basis by viewing

	bases can yield a better approximation of the underlying statistical
	distribution of the data and can thus lead to greater coding efficiency.
	This can be viewed as a generalization of the technique of independent

	The accurate identification of endmembers enables target detection

	consistent results with low computational complexity, which overcomes
	the disadvantage of the inconsistent result of VCA and the shortcoming
	of the high computational cost of SGA resulted from calculating the
	simplex volume. A comparative study and analysis are conducted among
	the three endmember extraction algorithms, VCA, SGA, and MVHT, on
	both simulated and real hyperspectral data. The obtained experimental

abstract = {Characterization of the joint (among wavebands) probability density function (PDF) of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data is crucial for several applications, including the design of constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors and statistical classifiers. HSI data are vector (or equivalently multivariate) data in a vector space with dimension equal to the number of spectral bands. As a result, the scalar statistics utilized by many detection and classification algorithms depend upon the joint pdf of the data and the vector-to-scalar mapping defining the specific algorithm. For reasons of analytical tractability, the multivariate Gaussian assumption has dominated the development and evaluation of algorithms for detection and classification in HSI data, although it is widely recognized that it does not always provide an accurate model for the data. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed investigation of the joint and marginal distributional properties of HSI data. To this end, we assess how well the multivariate Gaussian pdf describes HSI data using univariate techniques for evaluating marginal normality, and techniques that use unidimensional views (projections) of multivariate data. We show that the class of elliptically contoured distributions, which includes the multivariate normal distribution as a special case, provides a better characterization of the data. Finally, it is demonstrated that the class of univariate stable random variables provides a better model for the heavy-tailed output distribution of the well known matched filter target detection algorithm.},

	in hyperdimensional feature spaces. Then, we assess the effectiveness
	of SVMs with respect to conventional feature-reduction-based approaches
	and their performances in hypersubspaces of various dimensionalities.
	To sustain such an analysis, the performances of SVMs are compared
	with those of two other nonparametric classifiers (i.e., radial basis
	function neural networks and the K-nearest neighbor classifier).
	Finally, we study the potentially critical issue of applying binary
	SVMs to multiclass problems in hyperspectral data. In particular,
	four different multiclass strategies are analyzed and compared: the
	one-against-all, the one-against-one, and two hierarchical tree-based
	strategies. Different performance indicators have been used to support
	our experimental studies in a detailed and accurate way, i.e., the
	classification accuracy, the computational time, the stability to
	parameter setting, and the complexity of the multiclass architecture.
	The results obtained on a real Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging
	Spectroradiometer hyperspectral dataset allow to conclude that, whatever
	the multiclass strategy adopted, SVMs are a valid and effective alternative
	to conventional pattern recognition approaches (feature-reduction
	procedures combined with a classification method) for the classification

	The resulting ldquosparse least squaresrdquo (SLS) problem is also
	NP-hard, by way of its equivalence to a rank-1 sparse eigenvalue
	problem. Specifically, for minimizing general quadratic cost functions
	we use a highly-efficient method for direct eigenvalue computation
	based on partitioned matrix inverse techniques that leads to times103
	speed-ups over standard eigenvalue decomposition. This increased
	efficiency mitigates the O(n4) complexity that limited the previous
	algorithmspsila utility for high-dimensional problems. Moreover,
	the new computation prioritizes the role of the less-myopic backward
	elimination stage which becomes even more efficient than forward
	selection. Similarly, branch-and-bound search for exact sparse least
	squares (ESLS) also benefits from partitioned matrix techniques.
	Our greedy sparse least squares (GSLS) algorithm generalizes Natarajanpsilas
	algorithm (Natarajan, 1995) also known as order-recursive matching
	pursuit (ORMP). Specifically, the forward pass of GSLS is exactly
	equivalent to ORMP but is more efficient, and by including the backward
	pass, which only doubles the computation, we can achieve a lower
	MSE than ORMP. In experimental comparisons with LARS (Efron, 2004),
	forward-GSLS is shown to be not only more efficient and accurate
	but more flexible in terms of choice of regularization.},

  abstract = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate
	cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can
	be characterized as being localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable
	with the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have
	shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for
	in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output
	activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing
	this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological
	implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case
	when the code is overcomplete—i.e., when the number of code elements
	is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space.
	Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent
	of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis
	functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output
	function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations
	from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms
	of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical
	simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected
	interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral sensors collect hundreds of narrow and contiguously
	spaced spectral bands of data. Such sensors provide fully registered
	high resolution spatial and spectral images that are invaluable in
	discriminating between man-made objects and natural clutter backgrounds.
	The price paid for this high resolution data is extremely large data
	sets, several hundred of Mbytes for a single scene, that make storage
	and transmission difficult, thus requiring fast onboard processing
	techniques to reduce the data being transmitted. Attempts to apply
	traditional maximum likelihood detection techniques for in-flight
	processing of these massive amounts of hyperspectral data suffer
	from two limitations: first, they neglect the spatial correlation
	of the clutter by treating it as spatially white noise; second, their
	computational cost renders them prohibitive without significant data
	reduction like by grouping the spectral bands into clusters, with
	a consequent loss of spectral resolution. This paper presents a maximum
	likelihood detector that successfully confronts both problems: rather
	than ignoring the spatial and spectral correlations, our detector
	exploits them to its advantage; and it is computationally expedient,
	its complexity increasing only linearly with the number of spectral
	bands available. Our approach is based on a Gauss-Markov random field
	(GMRF) modeling of the clutter, which has the advantage of providing
	a direct parameterization of the inverse of the clutter covariance,
	the quantity of interest in the test statistic. We discuss in detail
	two alternative GMRF detectors: one based on a binary hypothesis
	approach, and the other on a "single" hypothesis formulation. We
	analyze extensively with real hyperspectral imagery data (HYDICE
	and SEBASS) the performance of the detectors, comparing them to a
	benchmark detector, the RX-algorithm. Our results show that the GMRF
	"single" hypothesis detector outperforms significantly in computational
	cost the RX-algorithm, while delivering noticeable detection performance
	improvement.},

	the sum of a smooth convex function and a nonsmooth, possibly nonconvex,
	sparsity-inducing function. We propose iterative methods in which
	each step is an optimization subproblem involving a separable quadratic
	term (diagonal Hessian) plus the original sparsity-inducing term.
	Our approach is suitable for cases in which this subproblem can be
	solved much more rapidly than the original problem. In addition to
	solving the standard pound 2 - pound 1 case, our approach handles
	other problems, e.g., pound p regularizers with p ne 1, or group-separable
	(GS) regularizers. Experiments with CS problems show that our approach
	provides state-of-the-art speed for the standard pound 2 - pound
	1 problem, and is also efficient on problems with GS regularizers.},

  title = {Dictionary Learning for Noisy and Incomplete Hyperspectral Images},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {submitted},
  pages = {1--29},
  abstract = {We consider analysis of noisy and incomplete hyperspectral imagery,
	with the objective of removing the noise and inferring the missing
	data. The noise statistics may be wavelength-dependent, and the fraction
	of data missing (at random) may be substantial, including potentially
	entire bands, offering the potential to significantly reduce the
	quantity of data that need be measured. To achieve this objective,
	the imagery is divided into contiguous three-dimensional (3D) spatio-spectral
	blocks, of spatial dimension much less than the image dimension.
	It is assumed that each such 3D block may be represented as a linear
	combination of dictionary elements of the same dimension, plus noise,
	and the dictionary elements are learned in situ based on the observed
	data (no a priori training). The number of dictionary elements needed
	for representation of any particular block is typically small relative
	to the block dimensions, and all the image blocks are processed jointly
	(“collaboratively”) to infer the underlying dictionary. We address
	dictionary learning from a Bayesian perspective, considering two
	distinct means of imposing sparse dictionary usage. These models
	allow inference of the number of dictionary elements needed as well
	as the underlying wavelength-dependent noise statistics. It is demonstrated
	that drawing the dictionary elements from a Gaussian process prior,
	imposing structure on the wavelength dependence of the dictionary
	elements, yields significant advantages, relative to the more-conventional
	approach of using an i.i.d. Gaussian prior for the dictionary elements;
	this advantage is particularly evident in the presence of noise.
	The framework is demonstrated by processing hyperspectral imagery
	with a significant number of voxels missing uniformly at random,
	with imagery at specific wavelengths missing entirely, and in the
	presence of substantial additive noise.},

  abstract = {In a sparse-representation-based face recognition scheme, the desired
	dictionary should have good representational power (i.e., being able
	to span the subspace of all faces) while supporting optimal discrimination
	of the classes (i.e., different human subjects). We propose a method
	to learn an over-complete dictionary that attempts to simultaneously
	achieve the above two goals. The proposed method, discriminative
	K-SVD (D-KSVD), is based on extending the K-SVD algorithm by incorporating
	the classification error into the objective function, thus allowing
	the performance of a linear classifier and the representational power
	of the dictionary being considered at the same time by the same optimization
	procedure. The D-KSVD algorithm finds the dictionary and solves for
	the classifier using a procedure derived from the K-SVD algorithm,
	which has proven efficiency and performance. This is in contrast
	to most existing work that relies on iteratively solving sub-problems
	with the hope of achieving the global optimal through iterative approximation.
	We evaluate the proposed method using two commonly-used face databases,
	the Extended YaleB database and the AR database, with detailed comparison
	to 3 alternative approaches, including the leading state-of-the-art
	in the literature. The experiments show that the proposed method
	outperforms these competing methods in most of the cases. Further,
	using Fisher criterion and dictionary incoherence, we also show that
	the learned dictionary and the corresponding classifier are indeed
	better-posed to support sparse-representation-based recognition.},

    provide understanding of oxygen transport on scales at which oxygen
    transfer to tissue occurs. To fully grasp the significance of blood
    oxygen delivery and hypoxia at microvascular levels during tumor
    growth and angiogenesis, the spatial and temporal relationship of
    the data must be preserved and mapped. Using tumors grown in window
    chamber models, hyperspectral imaging can provide serial spatial
    maps of blood oxygenation in terms of hemoglobin saturation at the
    microvascular level. We describe our application of hyperspectral
    imaging for in vivo microvascular tumor oxygen transport studies
    using red fluorescent protein (RFP) to identify all tumor cells, and
    hypoxia-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) to identify the
    hypoxic fraction. 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells, stably
    transfected with both reporter genes, are grown in dorsal skin-fold
    window chambers. Hyperspectral imaging is used to create image maps
    of hemoglobin saturation, and classify image pixels where RFP alone
    is present (tumor cells), or both RFP and GFP are present (hypoxic
    tumor cells). In this work, in vivo calibration of the imaging
    system is described and in vivo results are shown.},
